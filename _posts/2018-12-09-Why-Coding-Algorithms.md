Algorithm is fundamental of computer science, though it is not directly demanded by daily work. Continuing learning and solving algorithm problems makes me constantly aware of how many difficult problems exist in computer science area, and how tiny I am in computer science field. That is a big getaway for me, as CSer and tech worker, from the hype of all various of technologies, from up-and-down bubbled tech stock price, and from lucrative compensation TC numbers. It remindes me how I started CS track, and how I learned CS, and how I struggled CS. I like the feeling of appreciation among all challenging problems of CS.

Keep coding, keep learning.
