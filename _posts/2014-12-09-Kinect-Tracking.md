I would like to share my undergrad proj with my friends.

I Involved in Computer Vision research and Microsoft Kinect development. Designed and developed a high-performance face tracking application using depth image from Kinect. The project is implemented in C++ with OpenCV. 

**The importance of the project is that:**

1.    Your face can be highly covered by obstacles. (Demonstrated at 0:40)
2.    it is able to track face in dark environment! (Demonstrated at 1:40)

**Thanks to my advior: [Prof. Baoliang Lu](http://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~blu/)**
