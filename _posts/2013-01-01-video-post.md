## This is my first original video

I am using this video to test video-embeding function.

This is my first orignial video in my life. I happened to play the multi-player version of Flappy Bird online, a very popular mobile game for a time. I saw the source code and found that this game is purely made by javascript! How amazing! For the sake of respect, I hacked the code and gave the bird super power. I feel happy to see all of other birds fall down time after time, while my bird is free to cross the wall. I uploaded the video to **[bilibili](http://www.bilibili.tv/video/av967176/)** and has been watched by thousands of people, and got nearly a hundred comments. That's fun!
