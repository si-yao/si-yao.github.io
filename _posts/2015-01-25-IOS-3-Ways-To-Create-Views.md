I just started to learn iOS dev. And I discovered 3 ways to organized and navigate views for iOS. 

- Storyboard
- Xib
- By programming code

I initially followed the **[tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/RoadMapiOS/index.html)** provided by Apple, and it instructs to use storyboard to organize views, which is visualizable. And later on I found **[some other projects](https://github.com/fbsamples/ios-howtos)** are using xib. Some articles summrized the pro/con of those two methods. But the most interesting/technical way is to write view by code. I dig into the source code of **[Anypic](https://parse.com/tutorials/anypic)**, and fonud that programming the view is more universal though less visualizable. But I still love the third one. I found an **[article](http://codewithchris.com/xcode-using-storyboards-and-xibs-versus-creating-views-programmatically/)** the compares the 3 methods for reference.
